        I found him sleeping in the dungeon. A place i had no intention of going
        into if i was not running from those pesky demons in the first place
        neither did i intend to wake him up. Because that would be rude. Here
        lies the dreamer, in an endless slumber. The sleep granted to him by a
        mage to save the world from his wrath. Or so they say in the stories I
        dare not wake him up, not because i was afraid but because waking up a
        sleeping person is straight up disrespectful Plus stories are just that
        stories. <br />
        A person cant be alive for 1000s of years even if they are in a coma.
        but regardless of my intents, a snake had some other ideas. Our little
        scaly friend made me jump across the room and a relic was a casualty in
        my little misadventure. But despites its small stature, it must have
        been holding up this place because suddenly there was a loud explosion.
        It felt as if the ground was going to rip itself apart. <br />
        And in the smoke I saw a silhouette. I was in shock. I have done what no
        mortal should have done. I have awakened the dreamer………..
